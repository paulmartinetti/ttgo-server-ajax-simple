# ttgo node mcu ajax simple<br><br>
ttgo serves a simple Web page gui to any device connected to WiFi. Turn backlight on / off and display message on the watch that is typed into the gui when backlight is on<br><br>
To tweak the HTML, it's easier to edit the HTML in VSC then paste it each time into the Arduino IDE variable on the index.h page.<br><br>
The server or wifi connection fails pretty often. I have to close the IDEs, reboot the watch often..but otherwise it works. I started with the Hello Server example, but discovered that some libaries and code were not needed to do these simple tasks.<br><br>
The sketch only uses 13% of program storage space.<br><br>
